# Customer Default Risk Analysis and Segmentation Dashboard
This project focused on analyzing customer financial and demographic data to segment clients based on their credit risk levels. Using Excel for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for visualization, the analysis identified patterns and characteristics linked to higher default rates. The goal was to provide actionable insights to help improve lending strategies and reduce financial risk. 

### Objective: Identify high-risk customer segments to improve credit policies and reduce default rates and develop actionable insights to support targeted credit risk management and mitigate future defaults.

### Key Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard

### Tools and Skills Used
- Power BI (interactive Dashboards, DAX, visuals, KPIs)
- Excel (Statistical Analytics)
- Data Transformation
- Credit Risk Analytics
- Segmentation Analytics

### Key Findings:
- High credit utilization and low credit scores are strong predictors of default risk.
- Customers with "Fair" credit scores and credit utilization between 0.80–0.99 contribute disproportionately to total defaults.
- Late payment frequency serves as a reliable early-warning indicator of default, with customers in the "Fair" credit score segment showing the highest likelihood of repeated late payments.
- Moderate-risk customers represent the highest Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), indicating that targeted retention and credit risk management strategies could yield significant returns
- Employed customers has the biggest potential in terms of CLV(315M) but has the highest default rate with 35.02%
- Customers after the age of 60 years old provide the highest risk of default rate yet have a lower late payment habit.
  
### Strategic Recommendations:
- Prioritize monitoring and intervention for customers with credit utilization above 0.80 and “Fair” or lower credit scores. Early outreach or tailored credit limit adjustments could reduce their probability of default.
- Use late payment frequency, especially among “Fair” credit score customers, as an early-warning system. Trigger timely reminders, flexible payment plans, or personalized coaching to help customers avoid spiraling into default.
- Because moderate-risk customers represent the highest lifetime value, design targeted engagement initiatives—such as personalized credit counselling, loyalty benefits, or manageable credit restructuring—to retain them and minimize default losses.
- Given employed customers carry the highest CLV but also the highest default rate, tailor credit terms carefully—offering more flexible repayment options or monitoring usage spikes closely—to protect value while managing risk.
- Although customers over 60 demonstrate higher default rates, their lower incidence of late payments suggests defaults may stem from sudden financial shocks rather than ongoing payment behavior. Consider alternative assessments, such as income verification or hardship support, before taking restrictive credit actions.
- Deploy your segmentation framework to allocate collections and credit management efforts proportionally—focusing intense, high-touch strategies on top-risk, high-value segments, while automating lower-risk customer monitoring.

Regularly Review and Refine Segmentation Based on Dynamic Behavior
Monitor changes in utilization, payment behavior, and risk scores over time to detect customers moving into higher-risk categories early. This enables pre-emptive communication before default risk crystallizes.
