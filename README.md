# Customer Default Risk Analysis and Segmentation Dashboard
This project focused on analyzing customer financial and demographic data to segment clients based on their credit risk levels. Using Excel for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for visualization, the analysis identified patterns and characteristics linked to higher default rates. The goal was to provide actionable insights to help improve lending strategies and reduce financial risk. 

### Objective: Identify high-risk customer segments to improve credit policies and reduce default rates and develop actionable insights to support targeted credit risk management and mitigate future defaults.

### Key Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard

### Tools and Skills Used
- Power BI (interactive Dashboards, DAX, visuals, KPIs)
- Excel (Statistical Analytics)
- Data Transformation
- Credit Risk Analytics
- Segmentation Analytics

### Key Findings:
- High credit utilization and low credit scores are strong predictors of default risk.
  
- Customers with "Fair" credit scores and credit utilization between 0.80–0.99 contribute disproportionately to total defaults.
  
- Late payment frequency serves as a reliable early-warning indicator of default, with customers in the "Fair" credit score segment showing the highest likelihood of repeated late payments.
  
- Moderate-risk customers represent the highest Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), indicating that targeted retention and credit risk management strategies could yield significant returns
  
- Employed customers has the biggest potential in terms of CLV(315M) but has the highest default rate with 35.02%
  
- Customers after the age of 60 years old provide the highest risk of default rate yet have a lower late payment habit.
  
### Strategic Recommendations:
- Prioritize intervention for customers with credit utilization above 0.70 and “Fair” credit scores. Create an automated monitoring system that flag these accounts weekly. Use targeted outreach (email, SMS, or phone) offering reduced interest rates for partial repayment, or a gradual credit limit reduction to manage risk without alienating customers.

- Leverage late payment frequency as an early-warning trigger for “Fair” and "Good" credit score customers. Set up an alert system that automatically sends payment reminders after the first missed payment and offers flexible payment dates or hardship support after the second.
  
- Protect moderate risk, high lifetime value customers with tailored retention initiatives. Design personalized credit counselling sessions, loyalty perks for on-time payments, or short-term credit restructuring offers to keep them engaged while reducing default risk.
  
- Reassess credit terms for employed customers with high CLV but also high default rates. Offer tiered repayment plans based on income level, and use data monitoring to detect sudden spending spikes for early intervention
  
- Address higher default rates in customers over 60 years with targeted support rather than restrictions. Conduct proactive income verification every 12 months, and offer emergency hardship plans for customers facing sudden financial changes.
  
- Use segmentation driven collections and risk management allocation. Assign high touch strategies (personal calls, dedicated account managers) to top-risk/high-value groups, while lower risk customers can be managed through automated monitoring and reminder systems. High CLV customers should be targetted and restrictions for low CLV should be tighten for those meeting Risky Tier.

- Regularly Review and Refine Segmentation Based on Dynamic Behavior
Monitor changes in utilization, payment behavior, and risk scores over time to detect customers moving into higher-risk categories early. This enables pre-emptive communication before default risk crystallizes.
